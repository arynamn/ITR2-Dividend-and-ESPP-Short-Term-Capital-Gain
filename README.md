## üí∞ Dividend Calculation  

### Mandatory  
0. Update **Cell U9 = 0.03** if income above ‚Çπ50L.  
1. Open **E*TRADE Client Statements** for each dividend payment date between April 2024 to March 2025.  
2. Fetch the values:  
   - **Qualified Dividend**  
   - **Tax Withholding**  
3. Fill these values in Excel:  
   - `M8:11` ‚Üí Dividend earned (USD)  
   - `N8:11` ‚Üí Dividend Tax deducted in US at 25%  
4. Calculate average tax rate.
   - Calculate Total Income and fill at T2.  Total Income assuming no relief to dividend.
   - Calculate Total Tax and fill at T3. Use Income Tax Calculator, or utilize the ITR by skipping Tax Relief.
   - Average Rate = Total Tax / Total Income.
5. Auto-calculated values:  
   - `S8` ‚Üí Total Dividend INR  
   - `S10` ‚Üí 25% Tax INR  
   - `V11` ‚Üí 31.2% Tax INR  
   - `W11` ‚Üí Delta tax
   - `T5` ‚Üí Tax payable on such income under normal provisions in India (d) = Dividend * Average Tax (21.2% for me).

### Optional (For Personal Validation)  
If you want to validate values against all individual stock entries:  
1. Copy RSU Reports (till 31st March 2025) into `RSU` Sheet ‚Üí Columns `A15:O15` (append below).  
2. For each entry, use **Grant Date** and **Vest Date** ‚Üí Find Sellable Quantity from **E*TRADE Holdings Sellable Sheet/Website**.  
3. Drag/drop sample entry to auto-populate values in Columns `Q15:Y15`.  
4. Delete the first dummy entry after updating.  
5. Repeat the same for ESPPs:  
   - Copy ESPP reports into `ESPP` Sheet ‚Üí Columns `A5:K5`  
   - Find sellable quantity and fill **L5** (usually all ESPP shares are sellable).  
   - Drag sample entry to auto-populate `M:U`.  
   - Delete dummy entry.  
6. If RSU/ESPP were **sold in between**:  
   - Update Cells `U` and `V` for those entries.  
   - There are 4 IF conditions in Cells `U14` and `V14` (covering all 4 dividends).  
   - If sold, remove the IF blocks for that entry and make closing value = 0.  
   - *(Next year: Plan to script this for selling dates and partial sales support).*  
7. Check Cells `W11` and `X11`:  
   - `W11` ‚Üí Tax liability using E*TRADE Statements (**Correct one**)  
   - `X11` ‚Üí Tax liability using per-stock calculations  
   - Both should be same (minor rounding error possible).
